# Drupal

[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is one of the most versatile open source content management systems on the market.

This chart bootstraps a [Drupal](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-drupal) deployment on the [Okteto Cloud](https://okteto.com/) Kubernetes cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

It also packages the [Bitnami MariaDB chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/mariadb) which is required for bootstrapping a MariaDB deployment as a database for the Drupal application.

Refer to the [original chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/drupal/README.md) for advanced parameter configuration.
